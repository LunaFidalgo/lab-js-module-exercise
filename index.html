  <h2> Welcome to "Mars Rover" mission </h2>
  <p> 

    First of all, you have to initialize the grid: you must use the "initialization" function, which receives four arguments: number of obstacles, number of rows, number of columns and number of rovers (1 or 2).
    .Valid example: initialization(5, 10, 10, 2)
    <br> To control the rover you can make the following movements:
      <ol>
        <li> Turn the rover: "N" is north. "S" is south. "W" is west and "E" is east. You can do this with: turnleft ("l") or turnright ("r") functions. </li>
        <li> Move forward ("f")  </li>
        <li> Move backwards. ("r") </li>
      </ol>
    
      For this purpose, you can use the function "moveTheRover", which receives what movements you want to do and the rover you want to move ("rover" for rover 1 and "rover2" for rover 2)..

     <br> Ah! Remember: the rover is on unknown ground, so... there may be obstacles. 

    <br>Valid example: moveTheRover("rfffrfffb", rover); moveTheRover("rfffrfffb", rover2)
